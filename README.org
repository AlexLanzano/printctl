* printctl
A command-line utility to send commands to a 3D printer

** How to build
#+BEGIN_SRC
make
make install
#+END_SRC

** Creating a profile for your printer
In order to run the daemon you need to create a profile in the
~/etc/printctl/~ directory. Here is an example of a profile:

#+BEGIN_SRC
device=/dev/ttyACM0
baud=115200
#+END_SRC

The profile defines the way your computer is connected to the
printer. In this case, the ~ttyACM0~ serial device is connected to the
serial device with a baud rate of 115200

** printctl commands
~printctrl start [PROFILE]~ - start the daemon for the specific profile

~printctrl stop [PROFILE]~ - stop the daemon for the specific profile

~printctrl restart [PROFILE]~ - restart the daemon

~printctrl enable [PROFILE]~ - enable the daemon to start on boot

~printctrl disable [PROFILE]~ - disable the daemon to start on boot

~printctrl print [PROFILE] [FILEPATH]~ - start a print

~printctrl reconnect [PROFILE]~ - tell daemon to reconnect to the printer
